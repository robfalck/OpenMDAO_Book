# Units Definitions

This is a list of all the units defined by default in the OpenMDAO library.
Any entry in the `[base_units]` or `[units]` sections of the library is a known unit.
Valid prefixes are given in the `[prefixes]` section of the library.

Go [this document](core_features/defining_components/units) for details on how to specify units on OpenMDAO variables.
